#summary Connecting Galileo to a Camera - mmjuban

= What We Know =

   # The target camera to be used is the existing department's Nikon Coolpix P300
   # This camera uses PTP protocol and does not mount using the USB Mass Storage protocol (like Flash thumb drives)
   # An open source library and commandline, libgphoto2 and gphoto2 respectively, are available and has been used on RasberryPi
   *     http://www.gphoto.org/
   # We can access the microSD card as it is mounted in /media/mmcblk0p1
   *     I copied a few jpg files and one png file to the microSD card using the SD converter directly connected to my laptop but have not checked the files are actually there in the Linux commandline

= What We Don't Know =

   # How to enable gPhoto2 in the Yocto Linux image to establish communications with cameras using PTP

= What I've accomplished so far =

   == Creating the Linux image ==
        Downloaded LINUX_IMAGE_FOR_SD_Intel_Galileo_v0.7.5.7z from: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&DwnldID=23171
        Extracted image to 4GB microSD card
        Didn't work!!!
        followed instructions to create boot partition (see Image 1 on sidebar)
        Then it booted up from the microSD card (take a while) and the Blink sketch was retained after reboot!
   == Problems with unable to upload Sketches ==
        There seems to be a bug with Arduino 1.5.3 and the Yocto 0.7.5 image that causes  it to hang. Found the procedure to recover from here: https://communities.intel.com/thread/48975?start=0&tstart=0 
             IDE hangs on:
                echo "Deleting existing sketch on target" $fixed_path/lsz.exe --escape -c "mv -f /sketch/sketch.elf /sketch/sketch.elf.old" <> $tty_port_id 1>&0
            Procedure to recover:
                Exiting the Arduino IDE
                Killing the lsz.exe process
                Rebooting the Galileo (unplug power)
   == Establishing communications with the Linux partition ==
        use Poor Man's Telnet sketch from here: https://communities.intel.com/thread/48654?start=0&tstart=0
            upload sketch
            open up Serial Monitor
            set line terminator to Carriage Return
            set baud rate to 115200
            tested by using the following commands:
                uname -a 
                ls
                mkdir Melvin
                ls
                rmdir Melvin
                ls
            This method is limited though: "The script always spawns a new child prcess. The child process executes the cd command and then dies." but at least I know now that the Linux image is alive and working
        To get full communications we'll need to establish connection via Ethernet or serial cable... https://communities.intel.com/message/212631#212631
            I don't have a serial cable, USB-to-serial converter or a computer that has a serial port so we'll shelve that option for now. We'll go for the Ethernet connection
            I can't get StartEthernet.ino to work for me both in the office or home network to establish an SSH connection.
            Telnet worked: https://communities.intel.com/message/208564#208564 Yay!
                Establishes a telnet connection using putty
                Tested working in both direct laptop connection and home network connection modes (on my home laptop)
                Make sure to know the subnet and available ipaddress to use
                    I tried just letting the network assign dynamic IP using DHCP but it didn't work
                    Setting static ip worked on my home network:
                        system("ifconfig eth0 192.168.11.88 netmask 255.255.255.0 up");
                Select telnet in putty and type in the ipaddress and I was able to get full access to the Linux commandline interface!
               === Now to get this to work in the office using the work laptop... the saga continues ===
   == Establishing connection with the camera though USB ==
        Although my research on the Internet and actually checking the USB descriptors indicate that this camera indeed uses PTP and not the USB Mass Storage protocol I still had to try...
        First was to learn to mount a Flash drive to establish a frame of reference
            Using a USB-to-go cable I bought for my Android phone, I connected my 32GB Sandisk Cruzer flash thumb drive and the kernel recognized it as a USB Mass Storage device in /dev/sda1 by checking the kernel log via the dmesg Linux command (or lsusb)
            I was able to mount it to a directory I created called /flashdrive using mount /dev/sda1 /flashdrive https://www.suse.com/communities/conversations/manually-mounting-a-usb-flash-drive-in-linux/
        I tried plugging-in the Nikon Coolpix P300 but, as expected, it was not recognized as a USB Mass Storage Device. I tried with 3 other cameras, 2 Canon and 1 Olympus, lying around in the house hoping one of them might work. Unfortunately, all of them use PTP
        I tried running gphoto2 but the command is not found. Obviously this was not installed in the stock Yocto Linux image 0.7.5
        === Need to ask for help if someone has an image with gphoto2 installed or learn to do it myself!!! ===
== Compiling gphoto2 into the linux image ==
 # i replaced the 0.7.5 linux image with one that has compiling capability
 # downloaded the source code for libgphoto2 and gphoto2
 # copied the source code into the image
 # tried to `./configure` and got this error message:
