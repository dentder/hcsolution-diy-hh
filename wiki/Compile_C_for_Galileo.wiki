#summary cross compiler allows you to compile a code for Galileo

= Introduction =

A cross compiler allows you to compile a code for Intel
Quark SoC, on your computer, and then to move it to the
Galileo board to execute it.

Use the Linux Ubuntu 12,04
Follow the documentation here:

= Details =

1. Get package here

{{{ 
sudo apt-get install build-essential sed wget cvs
subversion git-core coreutils unzip texi2html texinfo
libsdl1.2-dev docbook-utils gawk python-pysqlite2 diffstat
help2man make gcc g++ desktop-file-utils chrpath libgl1-
mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mercurial autoconf automake
groff libtool xterm p7zip-full bitbake
}}}

2. download the board support package here:

[ http://downloadmirror.intel.com/23171/eng/Board_Support_Package_Sources_for_Intel_Quark_v0.7.5.7z ] 

3. Uncompressed

{{{ 
7z x Board_Support_Package_Sources_for_Intel_Quark_v0.7.5.7z 
 }}}

4. Rename your BSP folder with a shorter name

{{{ 
mv Board_Support_Package_*** BSPGLL 
}}}

5. Uncompress meta-clanton
{{{

hai@hai-Inspiron-1545:~$ cd BSPGLL/
hai@hai-Inspiron-1545:~/BSPGLL$ tar -xvzf meta-clanton_v0.7.5.tar.gz 

}}}

6. set up poky

{{{
source poky/oe-init-build-env yocto_build

}}}

7. copy the full image configuration from a sample:

{{{
cp ../meta-clanton-distro/recipes-core/images/image-full.bb ../meta-lanton-distro/recipes-core/images/image-sdk.bb

}}}

8. ... go to bitbake, got issue:(6/6)

{{{


hai@hai-Inspiron-1545:~/BSPGLL/meta-clanton_v0.7.5/yocto_build$ bitbake image-sdk -c populate-sdk
